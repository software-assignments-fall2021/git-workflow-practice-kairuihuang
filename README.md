Nishimoto examines the effect of context switching arising from multitasking from a software developement perspective.
She notes that certain companies might prioritize, or view positively, the ability to multitask, despite evidence
that people tend to be less productive when frequently switching between tasks. She consults Sophie Leroy, a professor
at New York University (at the time) for psychological evidence, which reveals key characteristics such as
*attention residue* (attention remains on the previous task despite already starting a different one), caused by
an inate desire to complete unfinished tasks. She also refers to Cal Newport's book *Deep Work*, noting deep
concentration and focus is critical for learning hard and complex skills. When applied to the software development
domain, she notes that an engineer who works on a team that requires a wide breadth of knowledge and skills will
likely context switch more frequently. She argues that the extra time spent setting up, learning, and switching
could be better spent in an environment that fosters deeper focus and concentration on a single task or problem.

I find this article to be very interesting and always wondered if knowing many fields was better than being very 
knowlegable in one field. I think I agree with the point that time would be better spent one one task rather than 
setting up and switching to another, because you tend to get more work done when you are focused and ready to finish 
the task at hand. I find that issues may arise more ofthen than not the more that you have on your mind.
